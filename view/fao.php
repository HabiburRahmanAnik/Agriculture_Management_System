			<h1>Are the farmers a ‘means’ of increasing production only?</h1>
			<p>No one is concerned about the interests and the health of the farmers. Farmers are only regarded as the means of increasing production. It seems their breath and lives are not something to consider</p>

			<p>Farmer Abdur Rahman from Noakhali died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on the first day of this year after three weeks in a coma. He died at the age of 55 when the average life expectancy of the country’s people is nearing to 80.<br>

			Abdur Rahman had long been suffering from diseases. Finally, he was diagnosed with lung cancer last year. He was undergoing chemotherapy treatment at the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH). In December last year, he sustained head injuries after falling on the bathroom floor and never regained consciousness since then.<br>

			In 2019, the year before the coronavirus pandemic broke out, several incidents of farmers falling ill on the crop field were reported in the country. Some of them also died while spreading insecticide. The media first reported such an incident on 4 March 2019 in the form of tragic death of Tarek Hossain, 20, from Monpura village in Kachua upazila of Chandpur. Many such deaths were reported from several districts including Bogura, Pabna, Joypurhat, and Tangail.<br>

			No major investigation were carried out over these deaths. No one showed an urge to carry out the investigation to find out the cause of their deaths. Police visited Monpura village two days after the death of Chandpur’s Abu Sufian. Nothing proceeds after that.<br>

			<h3>Why farmers make no complain</h3>
			A commentary titled “Farmers dying on their fields” was published in Prothom Alo on 21 October 2019. Eminent persons of the country issued a joint statement demanding a judicial probe after publishing the commentary. Several human rights organisations also vowed to go to the court. They, however, didn’t feel the urge due to a lack of interest from the affected people. Then coronavirus overshadowed everything including the death of the farmers.<br>

			Where is the time to think about the farmers who always stay at the bottom rung? Farmers, who produce food for everyone, are being exploited by everyone. That is why farmers or their families don’t want to file lawsuits and get involve in any hassle. In many cases, pesticide companies 'manage' things with the affected farmers.<br>

			Farmers are the main victim of cancer
			Now many farmers are reportedly dying of cancer along with the deaths of farmers in the crop field.

			Recent data and statistics of the government-run National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH) also confirmed it. The latest report (cancer registry report: 2015-17) of the hospital’s Cancer Epidemiology department says, about one-third of the hospital’s patients who are found to have cancer every year are farmers. Besides, the rate of cancer detection among farmers is increasing.<br>

			The NICRH’s count includes only the patients who went to Dhaka for treatment. Many farmers can’t afford treatment in Dhaka or even at divisional and district towns. Where will we find the account of those farmers?<br>

			<h3>Cancer among farmer on the rise in India</h3>
			Patients from Bangladesh who afford to receive treatment in India have heard of Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute in Rajasthan. Farmers from North India receive cancer treatment there at a minimum cost. Farmers from North India, especially Punjab, are growingly suffering from cancer.  Locals blame uncontrolled use of insecticide and fertiliser, increased pollution, and negligee of authorities for the spread of this lethal disease.<br>

			We know that the agricultural perspective of India and Bangladesh is not the same. Nothing from North India, including the physical structure of farmers, use of technology and machinery, weather, food habit, size of lands, ownership, food market consideration, government procurement policy, quality and quantity of incentives, are similar to us.<br>

			Differences are more than similarities. So, why do we find so many similarities in this life-threatening disease? Company and syndicate now rule the world; is it the reason that the same rejected insecticide is dominating both countries? The report of Kishore Tiwari from Maharashtra has pointed fingers at it.<br>
